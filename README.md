#### Warning :
While it mostly woks, it does have some bugs. Particularly, if saving a webpage does not work right, or there are no thumbnails of the saved page in the list, **go into settings, and turn off 'Save in background'**

Also, note that this is currently not under active development, as i have other stuff to do. ( Report any bugs  you find, and I might be able to fix them.)

## It can

* **Save real HTML**  files which can be opened in other apps / devices
* Download & **save entire web pages for offline reading & viewing**
* **Save in the background**, no need to wait for it to finish saving
* Nice UI (In my opinion anyway & needs more testing on different devices and screen sizes)
