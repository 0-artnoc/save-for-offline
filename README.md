# Save For Offline

Save For Offline is an Android app for saving full webpages for offline reading, with lots of features and options.

In you web browser select 'Share', and then 'Save For Offline'

## Features

* Save real HTML files which can be opened in other apps / devices

* Download & save entire web pages with all assets for offline reading & viewing

* Save HTML files in a custom directory

* Save in the background, no need to wait for it to finish saving

* Night mode, with both a dark theme, and can invert colors when viewing pages (White becomes black and vice-versa).

* Search of saved pages (By title only for now).

* User agent change, allows to save either desktop or mobile version of pages

* Nice UI (In my opinion anyway & needs more testing on different devices and screen sizes)
